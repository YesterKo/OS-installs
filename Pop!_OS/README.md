# Pop!_OS

## Installation

So, first up, has a very nice and straight-forward installer, and got installed with no hiccups.

## Post-installation

One thing I noticed very quickly is that the touchpad's right- and middle-click didn't work.

For that I installed GNOME Tweaks using `sudo apt install gnome-tweaks` and changed "mouse click emulation" under Keyboard & Mouse. [source](https://support.system76.com/articles/touchpad/)
